# ToDo List
## This project is a simple task management website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing the following features:

### Features
- View All Tasks: Display a list of all tasks with details such as description and status (completed or pending).

- Add New Tasks: Allows users to add new tasks to the list through an input field and a button.

- Edit Tasks: Users can edit the description of existing tasks. Clicking the "Edit" button next to a task makes the description editable, and changes can be saved.

- Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list using the "Delete" button.

- Change Task Status: Users can mark tasks as "Completed" or "Pending" using a checkbox or toggle button. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending ones.

- Search for Tasks: Users can search for tasks based on their descriptions using a search input field. The list dynamically updates to show only tasks that match the search criteria.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the content of the website.
- CSS: For styling the website and making it user-friendly.
- JavaScript: For implementing interactive functionalities like adding, editing, deleting tasks, changing task status, and searching tasks.
